I am a proud member of the robotics club! I was able to join team Astrea in
the summer of 2020 during the pandemic and it is definitely a strange experience,
but I enjoy every moment of it. I am a part of the mechanical branch of the club
and now we can go in person. It is so much fun to be a part of it!
