I am fascinated by the topic of Cybersecurity. With
our world growing more reliant on technology, more of our
daily lives become vulnerable to cyberattacks and the attackers usually
have the advantage over the defenders. This is more because if the are in
far enough that it gets noticed it means there is a vulnerablity that the
defenders couldn't plan for. I actually wrote a research paper for school
on it. Here is the link if anyone is interested:
